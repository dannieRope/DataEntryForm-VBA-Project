# Data Entry Form
This repository contains VBA modules, and form created whilst working on the  project.

The goal of this project is to create an intuitive data entry interface.
There are three different forms. These forms are simple to use and have data validation built in to minimize errors and cut down on the amount of time needed for data entry.

Additionally, the forms are made to store entered data in an organized manner that facilitates management in the excel

Two modules that contain some codes needed to run the forms are also included in the project.

Here are pictures of the forms that were made.
